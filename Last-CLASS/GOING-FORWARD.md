1. Locate some QA or related (web page maintenance) work for a non-profit, that will help build your resumé, your confidence, your skill set, and your LinkedIn profile.

3. Volunteer with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/).

4. Take a course or self-teach yourself: HTML5; Linux/Unix; and a scripting language such as Python, Ruby, or JavaScript. 

5. Buy a copy of the eBook *The Selenium Guidebook* (either the Java or Ruby version) and step through it, creating real tests as you go.

6. Join a Toastmasters Club! Nothing will improve your oral communication as much as a year in a Toastmasters club, and you'll have an incredible amount of fun doing so. Your resumé and LinkedIn profile will both look great with a **Toastmasters Competent Communicator Award** and/or a **Toastmasters Competent Leadership Award** on them.

7. Become as familiar as possible with your iPhone and/or your Android, and several apps for it; mobile app testing is a very hot field right now.

8. Join a Meetup in a related topic--one on Selenium, Appium, Testing, Agile, etc. There are lots of them in the Bay Area. Attend regularly! Talk to other attendees about what they do at work. 

9. Find a blog on a related topic and make a resolution to read it every time it is updated. Sauce Labs has a very helpful blog, but there are lots of others.

10. Completely fill out your LinkedIn profile--photo, education, job experience, volunteer experience, everything!

11. Build out your LinkedIn Connections with people you meet in class, at Meetups, etc.

12. *Follow* companies you're interested in via LinkedIn.

13. Join an open-source team, as a tester, writer (on the docs), or developer.

14. Look into online course offerings of [udemy](http://www.udemy.com), [udacity](http://www.udacity.com), [coursera](http://www.coursera.com), and [lynda](http://www.lynda.com).
 
15. Look at QA job openings in your geographical area often, even if you aren't "looking* at present, in order to keep abreast of what skills are needed to obtain and/or keep QA employment.
 
16. Keep your resumé up to date at all times! No more than two pages! No more than 10 years' worth of experience!

17. Do a Google "vanity search" and see how much you look like a QA professional to anyone who might be checking you out. Take steps to improve your "QA look."

18. Add more Selenium/WebDriver tests to your GitHub repo! This will show up on Google searches AND in recruiter searches.

19. Keep learning new QA tools! Almost every testing tool has a free trial of some length these days--take advantage of those to build breadth into your QA skill set.

20. Whenever you are asked to do an on-site interview for a QA position, be sure to prepare a presentation in advance that shows off what you can do for that specific company. Bug reports about their product, test cases for their product, screen videos of automated tests for their product, etc., can make a hugely positive impression.
